Single page site constructed only using HTML and CSS.  
  

***Summation of Aaron Gustafson importance of Progressive Enhancements***  

• Core tasks can always be achieved without JavaScript.  
• Core tasks should be done on the most stable layer (i.e. not JavaScript).  
• Progressive Enhancements is not anti-JavaScript. It is just about embracing the right technologies on the right layer.  
• “Because there is some chance JavaScript won’t run, we must always account for that chance.”  
• It’s never a good idea to ignore potential users.  
• Progressive Enhancements is just good engineering.

## Features

• Custom media queries created based on site design and functionality.   
• Custom svgs logos and assets.  
• Using system fonts so there is no external asset loading required. Rendering well on every mainstream operating system and helping to reduce the overall page weight.


## Project Workflow

### Initial Client meeting  
The client had previous sites built from templates. They had issues with updates and browser support. They wanted a basic site with little to no maintenance and rock solid dependability.
They clearly were looking for a dependency free site. No packages, templates, javascript or cdn dependencies. Using only browser supported html and css.    

***Client Directives***  
1. Dependency free.  
2. Reliability.  
3. Access to all devices.  
4. Clean and simple design.  
5. Single page.  
6. Green palette.  
7. Convey a reliable, serious and friendly presence.

**Wire frame**  
A wire frame was constructed to concentrate on the layout and functionality as a whole.  
Showing page structure, element placement and sizing.  
Determining responsive layout and page assets.

**Client Mock-up**  
A mid- to high-fidelity representation of how the final product will look and a rough idea of how it might function. Filling in the visual details.  
With the framework in place and client approval, using the  designs as a guide coding is done to accurately represent the approved design.
